# -COVID-19-Tableau-Dashboards
This repository contains my first Tableau project focusing on COVID-19 data analysis. The project includes two dashboards: one providing insights on international COVID-19 statistics, and the other focusing specifically on the COVID-19 situation in India. Explore visualizations and analysis of COVID-19 trends, including cases, deaths, recoveries.
