# COVID-19 Tableau Dashboard Project

## Overview
This repository contains my first Tableau project focusing on COVID-19 data analysis. The project includes two dashboards within the same Tableau workbook: one providing insights on international COVID-19 statistics, and the other focusing specifically on the COVID-19 situation in India. Explore visualizations and analysis of COVID-19 trends, including cases, deaths, and recoveries, variation, etc.

## Dashboards
The Tableau workbook includes two dashboards:
1. **International Dashboard**: Offers a comprehensive view of global COVID-19 trends, including total confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries cases worldwide. Users can explore data by country or region and analyze trends over time using interactive charts and graphs.
2. **India Dashboard**: Focuses specifically on the COVID-19 situation in India, providing detailed visualizations of cases, deaths, testing rates, and vaccination progress across states and union territories. Users can drill down into specific regions and examine regional disparities and trends.

## Data Sources
The COVID-19 data used in these dashboards is sourced from google, you will easily find this data.
